# Ohmyfood
Ohmyfood is a new startup that wants to make a name for itself in the restaurant business. The objective is to develop a 100% mobile-friendly site that lists the menus of gourmet restaurants. In addition to having a classic reservation system, customers will be able to select the dishes they want for their meal so that they are ready when they arrive. No more wait times in restaurants!
