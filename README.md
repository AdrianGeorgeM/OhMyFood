# Ohmyfood Paris - A Mobile-First Website with Dynamic CSS Animations

Ohmyfood Paris is an exemplification of modern web development techniques, creating a gourmet online food ordering platform that is as visually enticing as it is interactive. The project showcases a mobile-first approach, with CSS animations and transitions, crafting an engaging user experience. 

## Features

The website includes:

- A location-aware homepage with a brief company presentation and a section featuring the menus of four restaurants in interactive card format.
- Four distinct pages, each showcasing a unique restaurant menu.
- Consistent header and footer across all pages. The header features the site logo and a back-to-home button on the menu pages, and the footer includes an email link.

## Design and Interactivity

The Ohmyfood platform showcases a blend of interactivity and visual appeal, created using CSS animations and transitions. Restaurant menu cards expand on click, favorite menus are marked with a heart-shaped 'like' button, and a sliding checkmark indicates selected dishes. All these interactive elements are implemented using pure CSS, without the need for JavaScript or any libraries.

The design is underlined by a mobile-first philosophy, providing an optimal user experience across various devices. The designs fluidly adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and intuitive user experience. This fluidity is achieved through intelligent use of CSS media queries, enabling our design to adapt seamlessly across a variety of device widths.

## Compatibility and Validation

The website is fully compatible with the latest desktop versions of major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, providing a uniform browsing experience. Furthermore, it meets the W3C validation standards for HTML and CSS without any errors, ensuring adherence to web standards.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Use the command `npm run dev` to start the development server and automatically compile Sass files. The server will automatically reload when files are changed.

## Tech Stack

The project leverages:

- HTML5 for structuring content in a meaningful way.
- CSS3 for implementing designs, animations, and transitions.
- Sass for efficient and scalable stylesheets.
- Node.js and npm for managing project dependencies.

## Project Scope

The goal of Ohmyfood Paris is to redefine the online food ordering experience by offering a high-performance, interactive, and user-friendly platform. The project serves as a showcase of front-end development skills, including semantic HTML5 markup, CSS3 features, and efficient use of Sass for scalable stylesheets. The website is expected to evolve further by enabling online booking and menu composition features and extending the services to other cities beyond Paris.
